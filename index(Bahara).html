                I'm Bahara Noorzai, currently pursuing a major in Information
                Technology with a concentration in Software Engineering, and a
                minor in Mathematics at the American University of Afghanistan.
                To strengthen my coding skills, I am actively engaging with
                FreeCodeCamp's comprehensive curriculum, focusing on Responsive
                Web Design. This experience is helping me build interactive,
                user-friendly websites that adhere to modern web standards. In
                addition to my academic pursuits, I have studied UI/UX designing
                through a web development course, allowing me to create
                aesthetically pleasing and intuitive user interfaces that
                enhance overall user experiences. I am also developing hands-on
                experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects allow me
                to apply best practices in web development, enhancing my
                understanding of media queries, flexible layouts, and navigation
                design. Moreover, I am exploring advanced topics in coding, such
                as media queries for mobile-first design, version control
                through Git, and performance optimization techniques to create
                efficient and scalable websites.

            <div class="pra">
              <p>
                As a Computer Instructor at Khane Noor Educational Network, I
                leverage my academic background as an Information Technology
                student with a concentration in Software Engineering at the
                American University of Afghanistan. My role involves teaching
                essential computer skills and foundational web development to
                students, equipping them with the tools to navigate the digital
                world effectively. In this position, I design and deliver
                comprehensive lessons on topics such as Microsoft Office, basic
                programming, and web design using HTML, CSS. My focus is on
                fostering a practical, hands-on learning environment where
                students can immediately apply the skills they acquire. I
                integrate my ongoing education into my teaching methods,
                ensuring that my students receive up-to-date instruction on
                emerging technologies and best practices. Through this role, I
                continue to develop as both an educator and a student of
                technology, reinforcing my own coding abilities while
                contributing to the growth of others.

          <p>
            As part of our final project for the ITC 110 course during the fall
            2023 semester, I played a key role in developing the AI-Coders
            website. This dynamic and user-friendly platform showcased our
            team's diverse skills and creativity in web development. Utilizing a
            tech stack that included HTML for structuring, CSS for styling,
            JavaScript for interactivity, and Bootstrap for responsiveness, the
            AI-Coders website aimed to meet the requirements of our course while
            providing a polished and functional user experience.
